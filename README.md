# Lab 5
This lab exercise is the solution for "Lab 5. Traffic Light Controller  (Spring 2023)" of EE319K https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~valvano/Volume1/ .
The program is implemented on STM32F103C8T6 kit instead of TM4C123GH6PM, the logic remains though.
Instead of mounting leds and switch to a breadboard, I soldered them into a electrical board so that the signals can be observed clearly.
This program works.
